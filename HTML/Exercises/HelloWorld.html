        <h1>Giant Clam</h1>

        The giant clams are the members of the clam genus Tridacna that are the largest living bivalve mollusks.

        There are actually several species of "giant clams" in the genus Tridacna,

        which are often misidentified for Tridacna gigas, the most commonly intended species referred to as "the giant clam".


        <h2>Anatomy</h2>

        <P>Young T. gigas are difficult to distinguish from other species of Tridacninae. Adult T.

            gigas are the only giant clams unable to close their shells completely. Even when closed, part of the mantle is visible, unlike the very similar T. derasa. 

            However, this can only be recognized with increasing age and growth. 

            Small gaps always remain between shells through which retracted brownish-yellow mantle can be seen.</P>


            <h3>Largest Specimens</h3>

            <P>The largest known T. gigas specimen measured 137 centimetres (4 ft 6 in). It was discovered around 1817 on the north western coast of Sumatra, 

                Indonesia, and its shells are now on display in a museum in Northern Ireland. 

                The joint weight of the two shells is 230 kilograms (510 lb), which suggests that the live weight of the animal would have been roughly 250 kilograms (550 lb).</P>
